# This script launches the JLS circuit tester, provided JLS.jar and 
# JLSCircuitTester.jar are in the same directory
# as this file.

# $0 contains the "name" of this script (the command typed at the
# command line to launch it).  The dirname utility takes off the name
# of the file and leaves the name of the directory containing the
# script.  That directory name is then used to tell java where to find
# JLS.

# Notice that "." and $JLSCT_CLASSPATH are in the classpath.  This 
# allows java to find any user-written OutputSets.
